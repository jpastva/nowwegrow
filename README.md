NowWeGrow is an e-commerce application developed as a Capstone project for Northwestern University's School of Professional Studies MS in Information Systems program. It features an attractive, user-friendly, and accessible design. It includes functionality for browsing products, putting products in a shopping cart, creating an order, checking out, paying via credit card, and sending order confirmation emails to customers and merchants. The application also allows merchants to join the platform as a member to create a public-facing profile and list their products for sale. Users can manage their information via a highly functional dashboard with custom menus for both customers and merchants. Merchant locations are browsable as pins on a map using a Mapbox integration, and products can be searched using a search bar. The application has SEO features, including a sitemap, meta tags, and semantic markup using the schema.org ontology. Its primary database is PostgreSQL, and it offers a robust administrative backend for application management. A production instance of the application was deployed to Heroku, using AWS S3 to store uploaded images.

All files necessary for application are included in these directories. The demo application's database data is also available as a .dump file, db_backup.dump.
